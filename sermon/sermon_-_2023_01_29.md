# what

## know you tend to think wrongly about God (10)
  - cf Is 55
  - Ps 43, 50

## beware of cultural thinking (18–21)

    - Epicureus:
      - God is not involved in your life
      - there is no afterlife
      - do your best with what you have now
    - now:
      - do what you want
      - "I just want my kids to be happy, and I am a child of God; ergo, God wants me to be happy."
  - 
    - Zeno:
      - the gods are subject to the fates
      - there is an afterlife, but it's not important
      - live above what cause you to dread
    - now:
      - you'll be okay
      - this life is all there is
      - trust the experts
      - progress is the answer
  - cf Jer 23
    - 18 "who among them has stood in the council of the LORD?"
