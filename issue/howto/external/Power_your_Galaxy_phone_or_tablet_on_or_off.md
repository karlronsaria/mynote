There are a few different ways to turn your Galaxy phone and tablet on and off. You can use the Power icon in the Quick settings panel or even ask Bixby to do it for you. On many newer Galaxy phones, the Power and Bixby keys have been replaced with the Side key, which means you can use the Side and Volume down keys to power your phone on or off.

Depending on your device model, you’ll have a separate Power and Bixby key, or a combined Side key. Either of these keys can be used when you want to power down your phone or tablet.

Just press and hold the **Side** and **Volume down** keys simultaneously for a few seconds. When the Power menu appears, tap **Power off**, and then tap **Power off** again to confirm. To power the device back on, press and hold the **Side** key.

If your device has a dedicated Power key, simply press and hold the **Power** key until the Power menu appears. Tap **Power off**, and then tap **Power off** again to confirm. To power the device back on, press and hold the **Power** key.

You can also [**customize the Side key**](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00084203/) to have it open something else, like Bixby or the Camera app.

On many newer Galaxy phones and tablets, a Power icon has been added to the Quick settings panel. This makes it easy to turn off your device if it does not have a dedicated Power key.

1. Swipe down from the top of the screen using two fingers to open the Quick settings panel.

2. Tap the **Power** icon in the upper right of the screen (next to the Settings icon), and then tap **Power off**.

3. Tap **Power off** again to confirm.

To power your device back on, press and hold the **Side** key.

Bixby is always helping you out throughout the day, and it can also help you turn off your phone or tablet. You just need to [**set up Bixby Voice**](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00076739/). After Bixby Voice has been set up, press and hold the **Side** key to call Bixby, and then say "Turn off the phone” or “Turn off the tablet.”

However, you will need to use the Power key or Side and Volume down keys to turn your device back on. Please see the first section in this article for more information.
