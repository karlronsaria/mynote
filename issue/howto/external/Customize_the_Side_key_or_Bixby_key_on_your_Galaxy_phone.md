![A list of Side key options on a Galaxy S22 Ultra](https://image-us.samsung.com/SamsungUS/support/solutions/mobile/phones/galaxy-s/s22/PH_GS_S22ultra_Customize-the-sidekey.png?$default-high-resolution-jpg$)

If you can’t find the Power button on your Galaxy phone, don’t panic. Depending on your phone model, there won’t be a separate Power and Bixby button. Instead, they have been combined to create the Side key! This key can be programmed to perform different tasks, such as turning off your phone, calling Bixby, or opening an app. Since certain models have a Side key and other models have a Bixby key, you can review our explanations for both of these keys and their functions, so you’ll know exactly what your phone’s keys are capable of.

**Note:** Menu options and settings will vary by device model and OS version.

**Note:** The Note10, Note20, S20, S21, Z Fold series, Z Flip series, A50, A51, A71, A52 5G, and A53 5G have a Side key. The Side key can be customized to open Bixby or perform other actions.

Keep opening Bixby by accident when you press the Side key? You can remap the Side key to open any app of your choice. Navigate to and open **Settings**, tap **Advanced features**, and then tap **Side key**. From here, you can select your desired settings.

For **Double press**, you can choose between:  

* Open app (Tap the **Settings** icon to select an app.)  

For **Press and hold**, you can choose between:  

* Power off menu (You can also use the Quick settings panel or Bixby to turn off your phone.)  

For additional details about setting up and using Bixby, please check out our [**Bixby guide**](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00076739/).

**Note:** The Note 9, S8 series, and S10 and lower have a dedicated Bixby key on their left side.

The Bixby key on certain phones can be used for multiple things, such as waking up Bixby or opening specific apps. You can also choose what happens when pressing the Bixby key once or twice. Just remember that pressing and holding the Bixby key will always activate Bixby Voice.

For additional details about setting up and using Bixby, please check out our [**Bixby guide**](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00076739/).

**Note:** The Note 9, S8, S9, and S10 series or lower have a dedicated Bixby key on their left side.

If you don’t want the Bixby key to launch Bixby, then you can remap the key to open something else, like a frequently used app.

1. Open Bixby Assistant Home by pressing the **Bixby** key.

2. Then, tap **Menu** (the three horizontal lines), and then tap the name of your desired device.

3. Tap **Settings**, tap **Bixby key**, and then select an option.

4. You can use a single or double press to open Bixby. If you choose to open Bixby with a single press, you can double press the Bixby key to open another app or run a quick command - and vice versa.

5. For example, tap **Double press to open Bixby**, and then tap **Use single press**. Tap the **switch**, and choose what app to open or what quick command to run when you single press the Bixby key.
   
   **Note:** This function may be turned off when you reset Bixby or deactivate the chosen app or quick command.

If you want quick access to the Accessibility option on your phone, you can customize your phone’s Side and Volume keys, so they open up certain Accessibility settings. Now they’ll be much easier to reach.  

1. Navigate to and open **Settings**, and then tap **Accessibility**. Tap **Advanced settings**, and then tap **Side and Volume up keys**. 

2. Select the different shortcuts you'd like to appear, such as the Accessibility menu, Magnification, and whatever else you need.

3. To use your added shortcuts, press the **Side** and **Volume up** keys at the same time, and then tap the **Accessibility setting** you want to use.

4. You can also customize the Volume up and down keys to open up certain features that you use often. Follow the same steps described above but select **Volume up and down keys** instead. The same options will be available.

**Note:** If you choose only one Accessibility setting, it may activate immediately after pressing the Side and Volume up keys.
